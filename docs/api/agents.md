# Agent API

:::info Coming Soon
The Agent API documentation is being developed. This will cover:

- **CLIO Agent SDK** — Programmatic agent orchestration
- **Context Engineering API** — Building custom context pipelines
- **Workflow Definitions** — Declarative scientific workflow specifications
- **Event System** — Subscribe to runtime events and telemetry
:::

## Current Integration Points

AI agents currently interact with IOWarp through:

1. **CLIO Kit MCP Servers** — 16 servers with 150+ tools via the [Model Context Protocol](../clio-kit/mcp-servers)
2. **Python API** — Direct runtime interaction via the [Python bindings](./python)
3. **CLI Tools** — Command-line utilities for runtime management
