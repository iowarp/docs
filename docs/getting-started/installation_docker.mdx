1. Pull the IOWarp Docker image:
```bash
docker pull iowarp/iowarp:latest
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -d -p 5555:5555 --name iowarp iowarp/iowarp:latest
```

### Using Docker Compose

Docker compose can be used to start the runtime as follows.
`wrp_conf.yaml` is documented [here](../deployment/configuration.md).
By default, the container will support buffering to 8GB of DRAM.
More storage tiers can be configured in wrp_conf.yaml.

```yaml
  iowarp-runtime:
    image: iowarp/iowarp:latest
    container_name: iowarp-runtime

    # Mount custom runtime configuration (optional)
    volumes:
      - ./wrp_conf.yaml:/etc/iowarp/wrp_conf.yaml:ro

    # Expose ZeroMQ port for client connections
    ports:
      - "5555:5555"

    # Resource limits
    # Large shared memory for CTE operations
    shm_size: 8g
    mem_limit: 8g

    # Make IPC namespace shareable so benchmark containers can join
    ipc: shareable

    # Keep container running as a daemon
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true

    # Restart policy
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Start the service:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
